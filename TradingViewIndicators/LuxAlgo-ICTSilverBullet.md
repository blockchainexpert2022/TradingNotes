The provided Pine Script code is a comprehensive trading indicator designed for the TradingView platform. It is part of the "ICT Silver Bullet [LuxAlgo]" indicator, which focuses on identifying key support and resistance levels, as well as potential trade setups within specific timeframes known as "Silver Bullet" sessions. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionalities of the script:

### Key Components and Functionalities:

1. **Settings and Inputs:**
   - The script allows users to customize various settings such as the number of left bars for pivot calculations, colors for different elements, and options for displaying specific features like FVG (Fair Value Gap) and targets.
   - Users can choose between different modes for FVG display (e.g., "All FVG", "Strict", "Super-Strict") and select whether to extend FVG boxes or keep lines in strict modes.

2. **Data Structures and Variables:**
   - The script defines several custom types (`piv`, `ZZ`, `FVG`, `actLine`, `aPiv`) to manage different data structures efficiently.
   - Arrays and variables are used to store and manipulate data such as pivot points, trend directions, and FVG boxes.

3. **General Calculations:**
   - The script calculates pivot highs and lows using the `ta.pivothigh` and `ta.pivotlow` functions.
   - It also defines methods for checking the type of the financial instrument and determining the time session based on the timezone and session string.

4. **Methods/Functions:**
   - **`timeSess`**: Determines if the current time falls within a specified session.
   - **`in_out`**: Updates the ZigZag (ZZ) data structure with new points and optionally draws lines for visualization.
   - **`f_setTrend`**: Sets the trend direction based on the ZigZag data.
   - **`f_swings`**: Manages the calculation and display of swing highs and lows, as well as target lines.

5. **Execution:**
   - The script executes the `f_setTrend` function to determine the current trend.
   - It then processes the targets and updates the FVG boxes based on the current trend and user settings.
   - The script also handles the display of Silver Bullet session boundaries and updates the FVG boxes accordingly.

6. **Plotting and Visualization:**
   - The script uses `plotchar` to display markers for the start of Silver Bullet sessions.
   - It also plots markers for target highs and lows when they are hit.
   - A table is used to display a warning message if the user is using a timeframe longer than 15 minutes.

### Usage:
- **Silver Bullet Sessions**: The indicator focuses on three specific sessions: 3-4 AM, 10-11 AM, and 2-3 PM New York time. These sessions are considered critical for identifying potential trade setups.
- **FVG (Fair Value Gap)**: The script identifies and displays FVGs, which are areas where the price has gapped up or down, indicating potential support or resistance levels.
- **Targets**: The indicator calculates and displays potential target levels based on the swing highs and lows.

### Customization:
- Users can customize the appearance and behavior of the indicator by adjusting the input settings. For example, they can change the colors of FVG boxes, enable or disable the display of certain elements, and choose different modes for FVG display.

### Conclusion:
The "ICT Silver Bullet [LuxAlgo]" indicator is a powerful tool for traders looking to identify key support and resistance levels, as well as potential trade setups within specific timeframes. The script is well-structured and allows for extensive customization, making it suitable for a wide range of trading strategies.
